# Contributing to alsatian

Let's keep this simple, Social Coding should be fun so we're going to lay off the rules and only have essential rules so we can keep it that way.

## First off - thanks

Social coding is great so thank you for being a part of it! Hats off to you!!!

## The process

### 1. Issue

If there's no issue that covers the new feature or bug you'd like to fix then create one. Otherwise if noone is assigned to the existing issue just let us know you'd like to work on it.

### 2. Do your thing

Get your creative juices flowing, work however you want - there should be plenty of tools in place to help you along the way.

Get started with `npm install && npm run bootstrap`

Test your work with `npm test`

Tidy up your code automagically with `npm run lint:fix`

### 3. Pull request

There's a checklist whenever you create your pull request that'll help you check everything is in order before submitting. After you create a pull request our automatic CI checks will inspect your code and flag any issues if there are any. Then an Alsatian member will review the code and OK it to get merged and your wonderful code will be available in the next Alsatian release :)

## Asking for help

Everybody needs help sometimes and we are completely open to answering any and all questions you may have before, during or after contributing or even if you aren't contributing and just have a question. Just raise an issue or tag us in a comment and we'll gladly get back to you.
