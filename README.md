## Quick Start

If you're loving TypeScript then pop on down to our [TypeScript Quick Start](https://github.com/alsatian-test/alsatian/wiki/typescript-setup).

Otherwise if you're more of a JavaScript kinda person, have a gander at our [JavaScript Quick Start](https://github.com/alsatian-test/alsatian/wiki/javascript-setup)

Full documentation can be found on our [wiki](https://github.com/alsatian-test/alsatian/wiki/) the examples are usually in TypeScript but should be pretty much the same code for JavaScript (just lose the access modifiers and types).

## Alsatian is different

Using a different approach than other JavaScript test frameworks allows us to use more powerful patterns.

```typescript
// no globals and typing support out of the box with intellisense
import { AsyncTest, Expect, Test, TestCase, TestFixture } from "alsatian";

@TestFixture("whatever you'd like to call the fixture")
export class SetOfTests {
    
    // use the async/await pattern in your tests as you would in your code
    @AsyncTest("asychronous test")
    public async asyncTest() {
        const response = await somethingToHappen();

        Expect(response).toBeDefined();
    }

    // pass arguments into your test functions to keep your test code from being repetative
    @TestCase(2, 2, 4)
    @TestCase(2, 3, 5)
    @TestCase(3, 3, 6)
    @Test("addition tests")
    public addTest(firstNumber: number, secondNumber: number, expectedSum: number) {
        Expect(firstNumber + secondNumber).toBe(expectedSum);
    }
}

```
